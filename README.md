# TempConverter
A temperature converter written in C++. This project was an exercise in C++ in order to learn basic input/output streams, type limitations and usage, as well as basic syntax and compiler techniques.

The executable runs in the terminal, and is formatted to use simple I/O streams.

The user will indicate what unit of measurement to convert to, as well as which to convert from.
